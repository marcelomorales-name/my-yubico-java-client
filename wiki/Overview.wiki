= Introduction =

My Yubico Java Client is designed as a drop-in replacement for [http://code.google.com/p/yubico-java-client/], which is referenced on the [http://www.yubico.com/developers/api/ Yubico Web Service API webpage].

This one has some additional features that I could not live without.

  * Supports the complete protocol as specified on [http://www.yubico.com/developers/api/ Yubico Web Service API webpage]". On future versions, it will support every other alternative as I dive deep into the server code.
  * Generates and verifies the HMAC digital signatures.
  * Uses a precise and well known Java idiom, which can be used with any level of detail.
  * Uses [http://maven.apache.org Apache Maven].
  * JDK 1.4 compatible (for our poor fellas on enterprise computing which are stuck).

= TODO =

  * Spring security, jsecurity integration.
  * Threadpooled for control in high demand scenarios.
  * Non-attended testing.
  * Verification in different JVM implementations (I work with SUN's JVM).
