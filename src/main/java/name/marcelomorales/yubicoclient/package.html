    <h1>My Yubico Java Client</h1>

    <p>It is designed as a drop-in replacement for
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yubico-java-client/"><code>http://code.google.com/p/yubico-java-client/</code></a>,
        which is referenced on the <a href="http://www.yubico.com/developers/api/">Yubico Web Service API webpage</a>.
    It has some additional features that I could not live without.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Supports the complete protocol as specified on <a href="http://www.yubico.com/developers/api/">Yubico Web
        Service API webpage</a>. On future versions, it will support every other alternative as I dive deep into the
        server code.</li>
        <li>Generates and verifies the HMAC digital signatures.</li>
        <li>Uses a precise and well known Java idiom, which can be used with any level of detail.</li>
        <li>Uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>.</li>
        <li>JDK 1.4 compatible (for our poor fellas on enterprise computing which are stuck).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TODO list</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spring security, jsecurity integration.</li>
        <li>Threadpooled for control in high demand scenarios.</li>
        <li>Non-attended testing</li>
        <li>Verification in different JVM implementations (I work with SUN)</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</body>
